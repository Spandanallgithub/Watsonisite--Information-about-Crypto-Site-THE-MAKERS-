   <center> <h1>BITCOIN</h1></center>
 <p>Bitcoin (Abbreviation: BTC; sign: ₿) is a decentralized
digital currency that can be transferred on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network. Bitcoin transactions
are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger
called a blockchain. The cryptocurrency was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group
of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The currency began use in 2009,when its
implementation was released as open-source</p><br>

 <p>Bitcoin has been described as an economic bubble by at
least eight Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences recipients.
The word bitcoin was defined in a white paper published on 31 October 2008.It is a compound
of the words bit and coin.[14] No uniform convention for bitcoin capitalization exists; some
sources use Bitcoin, capitalized, to refer to the technology and network and bitcoin, lowercase,
for the unit of account.The Wall Street Journal,[16] The Chronicle of Higher Education,and the
Oxford English Dictionary advocate the use of lowercase bitcoin in all cases.
A few local and national governments are officially using bitcoin in some capacity; El Salvador
and the Central African Republic have adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, while Ukraine is
accepting bitcoin donations to fund the resistance against the Russian invasion.</p><br>
<center><h1>ETHEREUM</h1></center>
<p>Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ether (Abbreviation: ETH;[a] sign: Ξ) is the native cryptocurrency of the platform. Among cryptocurrencies, ether is second only to bitcoin in market capitalization.</p>

<p>Ethereum was conceived in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin. Additional founders of Ethereum included Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Anthony Di Iorio and Joseph Lubin.[6] In 2014, development work began and was crowdfunded, and the network went live on 30 July 2015.[7] Ethereum allows anyone to deploy permanent and immutable decentralized applications onto it, with which users can interact.[8] Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications provide a broad array of financial services without the need for typical financial intermediaries like brokerages, exchanges, or banks, such as allowing cryptocurrency users to borrow against their holdings or lend them out for interest.[9][10] Ethereum also allows users to create and exchange NFTs, which are unique tokens representing ownership of an associated asset or privilege, as recognized by any number of institutions. Additionally, many other cryptocurrencies utilize the ERC-20 token standard on top of the Ethereum blockchain and have utilized the platform for initial coin offerings.
On 15 September 2022, Ethereum transitioned its consensus mechanism from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) in an upgrade process known as "the Merge".[11] Consequently, Ethereum's energy consumption rate was reduced by about 99.95%, translating to an estimated 110 TWh of annual energy savings (110 billion kilowatt-hours).[12] The upgrade requires no actions from Ethereum's users.[13] During the Merge, Ethereum's proof-of-work mining mechanism was replaced with the Beacon Chain, a proof-of-stake blockchain network secured by validators staking ether.</p><br>
<center><h1>DOGECOIN</h1></center>
<p>Dogecoin (/ˈdoʊ(d)ʒkɔɪn/ DOHJ-koyn or DOHZH-koyn, Abbreviation: DOGE; sign: Ð) is a cryptocurrency created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, who decided to create a payment system as a "joke", making fun of the wild speculation in cryptocurrencies at the time.[3] It is considered both the first "meme coin", and, more specifically, the first "dog coin". Despite its satirical nature, some consider it a legitimate investment prospect. Dogecoin features the face of the Shiba Inu dog from the "doge" meme as its logo and namesake.[4][5][6] It was introduced on December 6, 2013, and quickly developed its own online community, reaching a market capitalization of over $85 billion[a] on May 5, 2021.[7] It is the current shirt sponsor[b] of Watford Football Club.</p>

<p>Dogecoin.com promotes the currency as the "fun and friendly Internet currency", referencing its origins as a "joke."[9] Software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer launched the satirical cryptocurrency as a way to make fun of Bitcoin and the many other cryptocurrencies boasting grand plans to take over the world. With the help of Reddit, the site became an instant hit. Within two weeks, Dogecoin had established a dedicated blog and forum, and its market value has reached US$8 million, once jumping to become the seventh largest electronic currency in the world.[10] Dogecoin is based on Scrypt algorithm, and the transaction process is more convenient than Bitcoin. Dogecoin takes only 1 minute to confirm, while BTC takes 10 minutes.</p>
