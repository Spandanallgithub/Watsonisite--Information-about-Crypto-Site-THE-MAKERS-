        <font size="5px"><p align="justify">Features of Cryptocurrencies A cryptocurrency is defined as a digital currency that is highly secured by cryptography thereby making it almost impossible for anyone to counterfeit. Many cryptocurrencies of the world are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology, a distributed ledger being enforced by a network of computers.</p>
        <p>In 2008, an individual namely Satoshi Nakamoto invented the first cryptocurrency namely Bitcoin, with the publication of a white paper namely “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”. Apart from Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, EOS, Cardana are some of the popular cryptos available in the current market. As of 2020, there are nearly more than 2900 cryptocurrencies that are being in trade with a total capitalization of over $221bn.</p>

        <p align="justify">Bitcoin Loophole Review is a new entrant of the crypto world and it has already created a strong footing in this emerging field. The best thing is that it uses faster processing and sustainable technology and works on a mathematical formula to calculate the exact nonce or nonce closer to create the hash and complete a transaction during mining. This makes the whole process four times faster than a traditional mining process.</p>
        Though cryptocurrency is still in its infancy, it has the potential to change the world. Cryptocurrency is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange like money. This means that the coins and tokens can be used to purchase goods and services, and can be traded like stocks.</p>

        <p align="justify">Cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency which is created and stored electronically in a particular digital environment. Cryptocurrency is not regulated by any country or international organization and thus, the value of it can fluctuate with time.</p>

            <p align="justify">Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security. It is also a medium of exchange that isn’t controlled by a single administrator, centralized organization, company, or country. Crypto is the only form of money in the world today that can’t be arbitrarily printed by governments and their central banks.</p>

                <p align="justify">Cryptocurrency is a digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank.</p>

                    <p align="justify">Cryptocurrency is a type of digital currency that only exists electronically. It is not physical and cannot be seen or handled. It has no physical properties to it and can only exist electronically. Cryptocurrencies use encryption techniques to secure transactions and control the creation of new coins, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC).</p>

                            <p align="justify">Cryptocurrencies are not printed like paper money, they are produced by computers all around the world, using free software programs that anybody can access. Cryptocurrencies are not controlled by any one country or banking system. They are decentralized in nature, meaning they can be sent anywhere in the world without having to go through a central bank or clearing house.</p>

Cryptocurrencies are not printed like paper money, but they are produced by computer programs called miners which validate transactions and add them to a public ledger called blockchain.</p>

Bitcoin uses SHA-256 hashing algorithm that produces a 256-bit hexadecimal number called hash which can be used for validation purposes.</p>
